# NSF_award_analysis

NSF is one of most important funding sources for researchers, especially those in fundamental areas like physics, astronomy, chemistry, biology, and many more. To do a good research is one aspect of the game of fund raising, to know what kind of projects are more likely to be funded is a very important aspect,too. It's not my interest here to talk about writing and communication skills here, which are equally important aspects. I'd like to find out, by means of data science, what projects have been funded by the NSF, and if there was any thing in common among these funded projects.

The data is from NSF website: https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/download.jsp
