# NSF_award_analysis

NSF is one of most important funding sources for researchers, especially those in fundamental areas like physics, astronomy, chemistry, biology, and many more. To do a good research is one aspect of the game of fund raising, as well as writing and communication skills, but none of these are my interest here, as a data scientist. what I'd like to find out, by means of data science, is what projects have been funded by the NSF, and if there was any thing in common among these funded projects. 

The data is from NSF website: https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/download.jsp, which contains the information of all funded projects since 1959, and it covers all the subjects and divisions. The trend of research focuses, collaboration patterns, and the state-wise differences, will be extracted from the data. Researchers should be able to benefit from the conclusions of this project.
